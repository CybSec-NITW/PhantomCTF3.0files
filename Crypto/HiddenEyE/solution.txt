the description says white SPACE ship which points to the whitespace programming language.
On searching ,we find an ide to compile the program
https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/
thus on compiling ,we see that the code is pushing some ascii values to the stack.
thus , we can decode them
OR
we can output the text using tab at each next line T	L



HINT:
on dcoding the brainfuck lang , the hint is "weird programming languages" which if searched on google gives a resuult of whitespaces.
