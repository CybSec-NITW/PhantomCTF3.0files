The qr code is distorted in such a way that it cannot be scanned . So , it needs to be reconstructed again .
On searching the web about it , i found a site qrazy.com for recreating qr code .
It clearly is a version 2 qr code .When reconstructed , it gives us a link to a website .
When we examine the site , and go to about page , we see many qr codes .
On scrolling down , we get 8 qr codes which when scanned give 4 letters each .
These when connected together leads us to the flag.
